Exercises and dev container environment for Debugging workshop at ICCS Summer School 2025

# Intoduction

This repo provides a devcontainer template which will setup the environment we need to run mdb.

## Examples

This repo contains some example programs to help you learn how to use `gdb` and `mdb`.

```bash
└── exercises
    ├── ex1_play
    ├── ex2_occasional
    ├── ex3_memory
    └── ex4_mpi
```

In each folder there is a `README.md` which contains instructions on how to run the example programs
and some helper scripts should you need them for guidance. Effort has been made to provide examples
in multiple languages, but this is not always possible. I appreciate some of you may be more familar
with one language over another, but I have tried to keep the examples as simple as possible.

If you finish the examples early, feel free to tackle your own codes in the wild.

# TODO
* add mdb vgdb example? add to ex4?
